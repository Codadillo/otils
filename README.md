# Otils

Otils implements oblivious and constant time primitives. These primitives are
helpful for developing applications that are resistant to side-channel attacks
in trusted execution environments (TEEs), e.g., Intel SGX.

## TODO
- ~~[ ] Add implementation of select for iterators over types that implement ObliviousOps.~~
